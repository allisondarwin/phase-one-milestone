                      <h3>I am passionate about creating.</h3>
                      <p>My name is Allison Darwin and I'm a budding web developer. I dove headfirst into web development in the fall of 2019 as part of a career transition. I love the idea of creating something from nothing and the endless opportunities for learning that come with programming. I'm starting my journey with front-end development and am excited to see where it takes me! My husband and I live in Durham, NC which we love. In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis, trying new restaurants, and listening to CodeNewbie podcasts.</p>
                      <p>My first love was personal finance which I write about on my blog that I will link to here. It's not up and running yet and this is just filler text. I will replace it with a description when it's ready.</p>
